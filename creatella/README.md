### `features added `
i add some feture to this project to make it easier to the client (please find the explenation below):

1- Search Bar => you can search for specific product bu using ID for this Product
2- Sorted by Id => you can sort the products by Size, Price also bu ID
3- Scroll Up Button => button appear when you scrolled down in the page and when you click on it , you go back to the top of page

### `features i didn't do it`
after every 20 products we need to insert an advertisement from one of our sponsors .

i can think to do this feature to add a state  with array lingth and make the length based on 20  and make a condition to check this state and if  
 this.state mod 20 === 0 and make another condition to check the state if === 20  as an example return a new componant contain Modal and inside this Modal add an image for Creatella Sponsers , if === 40 as an example return a new componant contain Modal and inside this Modal add an image for new Creatella Sponsers , if === 60 as an example return a new componant contain Modal and inside this Modal add an image for new Creatella Sponsers and so on to reach 500 which is the length of products array

 ## `use ready function from internet after i understand it`
i used some function which is ready on internet like : 

1- Loading function in material ui (Loading component)to loading spinner when you start the server 
2- Loading function in material ui (Spinner component)to loading spinner when you reach to the end of scrolling  
3- timeConversion and puralize to convert the time to sec, min, hour and day and compare it with the date in Api to return the
